#Notation of variables:
    ии* column 1: The subject who was in either the train set or test set was labeled with
            "train" or "test", correspondingly.
    ии* column 2: The identification number for the subject
    ии* column 3: The activity that a subject was taking
    ии* column 4-69:
             иииThe prefix "t" denotes the time domain signals, which were measured at a frequency
                of 50Hz.
             иииThe prefix "f" denotes the frequency domain signals.
             
             иии"Body" denotes that the values are measured for the movement of subject body.
             иии"Gravity" denotes that the values are gravity signals.
             
             иии"Acc" denotes linear acceleration, and "Gyro" denotes the angular velocity values.
             
             иии"Jerk" means that the value are Jerk signals derived in time.
             иии"Mag" means that the value are the magnitude of corresponding raw signals or Jerk signals, calculated using the Euclidean norm 
             
             иии"X","Y","Z" denotes the values for the three dimension in Euclidean space.
             
             иии"mean" and "std" denote the mean and standard deviation for the measured value, correspondingly.


#data
иииThis is the [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) of raw data provided on the course website

иииSee the [detailed description](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) of the data at:          

иииThe mean and standard deviation for the measurement were selected to be presented in the final tidy data set.

иииThe data in the final tidy data set is grouped by "train" or "test" group, and the variables are presented for each activity that a subject was taking


#Data processing procedure
   ии1. Load the "train" and "test" data set into R, separately.
   ии2. Create new variables for labelling each observation, using "subject" and "activity" labels.
   ии3. Mark the "train" and "test" group with corresponding tag.
   ии4. Combine the "train" and "test" data and subset the data set to extract the mean and standard deviation values.
   ии5. Group the subsetted data set by "group", "subject" and "activity", then apply mean function to obtain the mean values,
        this results in the final tidy data set.
   ии6. Export the final data set to a .txt file.
